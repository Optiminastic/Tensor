/**
 * Tailwind-merge, taught about BoardUI's text styles.
 *
 * NOT a duplicate of `cn` in lib/utils.ts, and not removable in favour of it.
 * BoardUI's components combine a SIZE class (`text-body-medium`) with a COLOUR
 * class (`text-text-primary`); plain tailwind-merge sees two `text-*` utilities,
 * assumes they conflict, and drops the first. This instance is configured to
 * know the difference.
 *
 * The styles themselves live in the BoardUI bridge in app/globals.css - the
 * generated styles/typography.css was discarded so Tensor keeps one palette and
 * one type scale.
 *
 * Text-style classes.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: every text-* utility we define via @theme (e.g. `text-body-medium`,
 * `text-title-1-semibold`) must be listed here. Otherwise tailwind-merge — which
 * has no view of our Tailwind theme — treats them as text-color utilities and
 * silently drops them when they appear in the same className as a real color
 * (`text-foreground-full`, `text-text-primary`, etc).
 *
 * If you add or rename a text style in the bridge, mirror the change here.
